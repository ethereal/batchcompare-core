Batch-Compare
------------------------------------
A structured-text analysis framework

The batchcompare framework specializes at analyzing structured text and generic
key-value based data. (i.e. web-service XML messages) Analysis is performed
using different metrics (i.e. key matching, levenstein distance, ...) and
filters that can be combined and optimized for performance in a flow-like
processing architecture.
